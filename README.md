# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to take raw data from the PyBer app and sort it by the city types (Rural, Urban, & Suburban) and to visualize how the fares, rides, and driver counts differ between the three city types and what suggestions we can make to improve the service.


### Results

The results show that Urban rides are the clear top followed by Suburban and Rural. Urban boasted 1625 rides, with 2405 total drivers and a total fare amongst them of $34,854.38. Conversely, Rural cities are lacking with a total ride count of 125, driver count of 78 and total fare of $4327.93. However, even with such a low rider count, Rural drivers are on average paid 3x more per trip than those who drive in Urban cities, with an average of $55.49 over Urbans $16.57.

When looking at the weekly fare per city type from Jan 1, 2019 until Apr 29, 2019, we can see that the density of the city plays a huge part in the total fares. Even though Urban average costs per ride are much lower than that of Rural and Suburban.
